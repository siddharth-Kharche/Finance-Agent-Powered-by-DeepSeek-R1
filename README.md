# Finance Agent Team - Powered by DeepSeek-R1 LLM Model ðŸ§ ðŸ’¼

## Overview
The **Finance Agent Team** is a Streamlit-based application that leverages the **deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b** model from Groq to provide users with advanced conversational capabilities. This app integrates two specialized agents:

1. **Web Agent**: Searches the web for information using DuckDuckGo.
2. **Finance Agent**: Provides financial data such as stock prices, analyst recommendations, company information, and news using YFinanceTools.

Both agents are backed by Groq's powerful LLM and are designed to deliver accurate and contextual insights.

- **Financial Data Retrieval**: The Finance Agent delivers comprehensive insights into stocks and companies.
- **Agent Team Collaboration**: Combines the strengths of both agents to answer complex multi-domain queries.
